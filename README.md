# ZiraApp

Hey Guys,

This is **ZIRA Tickets App** :

• I've Used **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS** for UI and adding functionalities to App.

• Different tasks in the form of tickets can be added/removed.

• Priority of tasks can be set by assigning dierent colors to tickets.

• Provides a unique id for every ticket. A ticket with certain priority color can be
displayed by selecting a color from the priority bar.

• **Local storage** is used as **DataBase** to retrieve and load tickets.
